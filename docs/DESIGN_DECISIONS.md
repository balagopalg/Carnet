  DESIGN LOGIC
  *      In this project, we are trying to design a solution for the main problem faced by a customer when he is going to buy a used vehicle.When anyone is looking for a used,he maynot know whether the vehicle met with an accident anytime,the insurance is claimed or not.
     
  *      This issue can be solved by adding the insurance history of the vehicle to blockchain.When the customer have provision to check the insurance details of the vehicle,he can understand whether the vehicle had an accident or not.

  *      The project is desigend in such a way that there have two seperate option for agent and customer in homepage

  *      The agent have a username and password for login into the desired page which makes it not accessible to other peoples.

  *      The agent and customer can access the required operations by giving the vehicle's register number.This is designed in the sense that every vehicle have a particular register number.


  ADDRESSING SCHEME

  *      The addressing scheme of the project is designed in such a way that all the operations performed in the application is based on the vehicle's register number.

  *      The private key and public key of the register number will be created which is used to design the addressing 

  *      Since every vehicle have a particular register number, all the operations designed in this project can be performed by the address created by hashing the public key of the vehicle

  *      The customer ,by using the register number, can view the details of the particular vehicle.

  *      By using the register number for address scheme, details of every particular vehicle can be stored and and can be retrieved back.
